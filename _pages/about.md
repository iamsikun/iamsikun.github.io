I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Supply Chain, Operations, and Technology](https://olin.wustl.edu/EN-US/academic-programs/PhD/Pages/PhdDetail.aspx?username=sikun) at Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis. I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Dennis Zhang](http://denniszhang.org/) and Prof. [Raphael Thomadsen](https://apps.olin.wustl.edu/faculty/thomadsen/). My research interests are causal inference, machine learning, and data-driven optimization. I'm also interested in their application in marketing, operations, and quantitative finance.
