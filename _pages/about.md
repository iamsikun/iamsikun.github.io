I am a Ph.D. student in [Supply Chain, Operations, and Technology](https://olin.wustl.edu/EN-US/academic-programs/PhD/Pages/PhdDetail.aspx?username=sikun) at Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis. My research interests are data-driven decision-making, causal inference, learning algorithms, and sequential decision analytics. I'm also interested in their application in operations, marketing, and quantitative finance.
